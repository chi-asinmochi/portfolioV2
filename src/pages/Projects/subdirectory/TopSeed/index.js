                        <p>During the early design phase, TopSeedâ€™s business plan was still in its infancy. Much of the logistics, such as post-purchase delivery, was but a few vague concepts with details that were either missing or likely going to change in the future. As a result I often had to take on new trajectories during the middle of a design.</p>

                        <h4>Lessons</h4>
                        <p>I should always design with scalability in mind and donâ€™t rush into high-fidelity details too soon. Sometimes all I needed was a user flow to examine the feasibility of a concept or to communicate ideas across teams.</p>
